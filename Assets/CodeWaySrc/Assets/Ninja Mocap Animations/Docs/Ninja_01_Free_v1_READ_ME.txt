5 Ninja MoCap Animations - Free sample set of ninja animations for game development.

- Small free set of ninja animations for game development and CG production.
- Idle and transitions have been carefully pose-matched, for seamless motion trees.
- All animations are .fbx format, standard fbx bone names.
- Provided Motus Man character is copyright © Motus Digital, LLC

If using these motion files in Unity 3D, setting the Rig to Humanoid will allow the animations to control another character.
Typical use would be "MotusMan_v2.fbx" as the main Avatar, and setting the animation files to copy its Avatar.
